# NSE

> While Nmap isn't a comprehensive vulnerability scanner, NSE is powerful enough to handle even demanding vulnerability checks.  It could serve as a backup to a purpose-built scanner.

## Find all NSE vuln Scripts

```bash
#PWD should be /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
cat script.db | grep "vuln"
```
## Watch info about a Script

```bash
nmap --script-help=$SCRIPTNAME
```

## Run vuln Scripts

```bash
#Run all scripts at once:
nmap --script vuln $IPADDRESS
#Run specific script:
nmap --script=$SCRIPTNAME $IPADDRESS
```
