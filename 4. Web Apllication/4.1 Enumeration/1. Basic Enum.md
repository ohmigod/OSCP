# Basic enum

> We should identify as much information  as we can about the application. Hit every button, register, try crazy things... in the end, try to know what the application is doing.

## Technology stack to discover:

* Programming language and Frameworks
* Web server Software
* Database Software
* Server OS

## URLs

URLs can give us a lot of information. By looking at the filetypes we can idenfity the programming language. Example: (.php). Most common are:

| **File extension**     | **Application/Programming language** |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| .php                   | PHP Source Code File
| .js                    | JavaScript Source Code File         |
| .aspx                  | Microsoft ASP.NET framework. Also called ".NET Web forms."|
| .asp                   | May contain scripts written in VBScript or JavaScript |
| .cgi                   | Writen in C or Perl. Are often used for running basic web scripts.|

_____
## Source Code

Sometimes, source code can provide good source of information like hidden paths, comments, client-side controls, and more. Most common are:

  * Software versions
  * Comments
  * URLs
  * Subdomains

We can also use the **Web Developer Menu** to inspect the page (Ctrl+Shift+K).

Find interesting info:

```bash
curl 10.11.1.71 -s -L | grep -o '[^/]*\.$DOMAIN\.com' $FILE
curl 10.11.1.71 -s -L | grep "title\|href" | sed -e 's/^[[:space:]]*//'
```
_____
## Robots.txt & Sitemap.xml

Inspect /robots.txt or /sitemap.xml (sometimes the name varies) files. You never know if there is something interesting here.
______
## Admin consoles

We should check for remote admin console web applications like:

* /manager/html (Tomcat)
* /phpmyadmin (MySQL)

_____

## Certificate Details

If there is a website running on port 443, inspect the certificate details, this might contain useful information.

_____

## /cgi-bin/

If we found any cgi script under /cgi-bin/ directory (brute-force using Seclists custom wordlist) and we can execute them, it indicates that there is a module loaded by Apache, mod_cgi (which is what handles all the CGI requests)
