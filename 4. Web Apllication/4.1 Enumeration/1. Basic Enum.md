# Basic enum

> We should identify as much information  as we can about the application. Hit every button, register, try crazy things... in the end, try to know what the application is doing.

## Technology stack to discover:

* Programming language and Frameworks
* Web server Software
* Database Software
* Server OS

## URLs

URLs can give us a lot of information. By looking at the filetypes we can idenfity the programming language. Example: (.php). Most common are:

| **File extension**     | **Application/Programming language** |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| .php                   | PHP Source Code File
| .js                    | JavaScript Source Code File         |
| .aspx                  | Microsoft ASP.NET framework. Also called ".NET Web forms."|
| .asp                   | May contain scripts written in VBScript or JavaScript |
| .cgi                   | Writen in C or Perl. Are often used for running basic web scripts.|

## Source Code

Sometimes, source code can provide good source of information like hidden paths, comments, client-side controls, and more.

We can also use the **Web Developer Menu** to inspect the page (Ctrl+Shift+K).
