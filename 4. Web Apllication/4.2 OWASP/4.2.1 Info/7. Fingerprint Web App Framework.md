#  Fingerprint Web Application Framework

> With the vast number of Open Source software projects, it is likely that the target is dependent on these well known frameworks (phpBB, WordPres..).

#### HTTP Headers

The most basic is to look at the **X-Powered-By** field in the response header. Carefully inspect every HTTP-header for such leaks.
_____
#### Cookies

Specific cookies can be set by the application framework although it is configurable.

```bash
Cookie: CAKEPHP=rm72iaojsdi1j24hoo1df
```

**Special cookies:**

|**Frakework**|**Cookie name**|

#### HTML Source Code 

This technique is based on finding certain patterns in the HTML page source code (comments, versions, paths...).

**Special markers:**

|Framwork|Keyword|
|--------|-------|
|Adobe ColdFusion|<!--START headerTags.cfm|
|Microsoft ASP.NET|__VIEWSTATE|
|ZK      |<!-- ZK|
|Business Catalyst| <!-- BC_OBNW|
|Indexhibit|ndxz-studio|

_____
#### Specific files and folders

Every web component has its own specific file and folder structure on the server. Dirbusting can uncover them.

```bash
/wp-content
/wp-admin
/wp-includes
```

Specific paths can also be found on robots.txt.
_____
#### Error Messages

Error messages can reveal the framework and some path structure.
