# Test Sharing Sites

> Text-sharing “pastebin” sites, such as Pastebin and Pastie are a popular repository of compromised data. Keeping an eye on these websites can help identify a breach related to the organization. They can also help during the reconnaissance phase of a penetration testing project, allowing the assessor to collect sensitive information about the target for follow-up attacks.

**Common sites:**

[Pastebin](https://pastebin.com)

[Pastie](http://pastie.org)

[FrubarPaste](http://paste.frubar.net/15565)

[Codepad](http://codepad.org)

[Slexy](https://slexy.org)

In some cases, perpetrators of computer breaches post the data they have stolen on such sites. Sometimes, sensitive information is unwittingly leaked by a company’s employee. This includes:

* Stolen data

* Source code snippets that might reveal website inner-workings

* Configuration details of network devices

* Employee names, contact details and job functions

### PasteHunter:

[PasteHunter](https://github.com/kevthehermit/PasteHunter) is a python3 application that is designed to query a collection of sites that host publicly pasted data. For all the pastes it finds it scans the raw contents against a series of Yara rules looking for information that can be used by an organisation or a researcher.
