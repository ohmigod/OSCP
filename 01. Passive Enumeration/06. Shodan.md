> Shodan is the search engine for everything on the internet. While Google and other search engines index only the web, Shodan indexes pretty much everything else â€” web cams, water treatment facilities, yachts, medical devices, traffic lights, wind turbines, license plate readers, smart TVs, refrigerators, anything and everything you could possibly imagine that's plugged into the internet (and often shouldn't be).
