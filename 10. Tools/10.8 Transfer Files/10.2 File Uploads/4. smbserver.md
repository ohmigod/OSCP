# SMB Server

> SMB is another convenient file transfer protocol, which is very common amongst Windows environments. You can easily set up an SMB server with Impacketâ€™s smbserver.py program.

```bash
python smbserver.py $SHARENAME /$ROOTDIR
#Doesn't work? try using -smb2support flag:
python smbserver.py -smb2support $SHARENAME /$ROOTDIR

#On the target, you can view the available shares on the SMB server with:
net view \\\$IPADDRESS

#To view the files available in the share, simply use dir:
\\$IPADDRESS\share-name

#To actually download a file, use:
copy \\$IPADRESS\share-name\file out-file
```
