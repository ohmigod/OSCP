## enum4linux and smbclient fix for "protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_DISCONNECTED"

The fix is simple, just took a little digging. You just need to tell your smbd daemon to use the weaker and more insecure protocols, which it will not do my default in the current version. For note: if you are using smbd in real life for file and printer sharing, I don't recommend leaving you system like this.

All that you have to do is edit your /etc/samba/smb.conf and add one line to the global section (which tells your system to use the old protocols when negotiating a session):

client min protocol = LANMAN1

Save the file, hup the daemon, use your tools.

service smbd restart
