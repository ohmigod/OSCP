# Compiling exploits from Linux to Windows

There are times that we are on Linux and some exploits needs to compile from a Windows machine (requieres dependencies). In this case, we can use a cross-compiler to help in the way:

```bash
#Install:
apt install mingw-w64

#Usage:
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc $EXPLOITFILENAME.c -o $OUTPUTNAME.exe
#In case of error, try adding the flag: -lws2_32
```

**Note:** It's always better to do it on it's own platform.
