# Port scan

> Port scanning is the process of discovering TCP and UDP open ports on the target host or network. Open ports reveal the services that are running upon the network. We perform port scanning in order to look for potential entry points into the systems.

### /dev/tcp One-liner 

```bash
#Change $IPADDRESS:
top10=(20 21 22 23 25 80 110 139 443 445 3389); for i in "${top10[@]}"; do (echo > /dev/tcp/$IPADDRESS/"$i") > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Port $i is open" || echo "Port $i is closed"; done
```

### TCP 3 way handshake one-liner scanner:

```bash
#PORTRANGE can be: 1-65535, 80, 1-1000, ...
#-w specifies the connection timeout in seconds
#-z is used to specify 0 data sent (scan mode)
nc -nvv -w 1 -z $IPADDRESS $PORTRANGE
```


### UDP one-liner scanner:
> UDP is a connectionless protocol, no handshake is used like TCP. In this case, when you send a UDP packet to a port, if the port is open you don't receive any data (depends on how the server is configured). In the other way, when the port is closed, you receive an "ICMP port unreachable" (care with this, maybe there is a firewall that blocks ICMP packets and we receive false positives).

```bash
#-u specifies UDP scan
nc -nvv -u -w 1 -z $IPADDRESS $PORTRANGE
```

## NMAP

```bash
nmap {flags} {IP_Address}
```

| **Flag**    | **Description**                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| -sT         | TCP Scan (completes 3 way handshake) |
| -sS         | TCP SYN Scan (faster than TCP Scan)  |
| -sU         | UDP Scan                             |
| -sn         | Used to perform host discovery in large networks|      
| -sV         | Version Scan                         |
| -sC         | Run default scripts                  |
| -O          | Detect OS                            |
| -A          | Aggressive Scan (include -sV -sC -O) |
| -oA/N/X/G   | Output in all/normal/XML/grep formats|
| -Pn         | No ping                              |
| --script=   | Nmap Script Engine                   |
| --open      | Display only open ports              |
| -v          | Verbose. Display output in real time |
| -n          | No DNS resolution                    |
| --min-rate X| Send packet no more slow than X/s    |
| --reason    | Displays the reason of port status   |


Notes:

* TCP Scan is useful when scanning via certain types of proxies.
* For common UDP ports nmap will send protocol-specified packets in attempt to get a response from an application.
* Banners from version scan (-sV) can be modified by sysadmins to fake service names in order to mislead potentional attackers.
* Nmap scripts are located at: /usr/share/nmap/scripts


####  Host discovery

```bash
#Useful in large networks. First, scan to find hosts alive and then perform more complex scanning techniques.
nmap -sn $IPRANGE
```

##### Quick all-ports scan
```bash
#-TX: Chage X (0-5) if not in a controlled environment
nmap -p- --open -T5 -v -n $IPADDRESS -oG scan.nmap
```

#### Vuln Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -vv -Pn -n -sV --script vuln $IPADDRESS
```
