# SMTP

> SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers. Most e-mail systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another; the messages can then be retrieved with an e-mail client using either POP or IMAP.

## Banner identification

Possible options to obtain the banner if they have been left with the default configuration:

* Using nmap
* Connect to the server using Telnet o netcat (wait a bit)
* Metasploit auxiliar module: /scanner/smtp/smtp_version

Once we get the banner, we can search for vulnerabilities if the version is not updated.

## NMAP & msf scripts

```bash
--script=smtp-*
auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_relay
auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version
```

## User enumeration

SMTP have their own set of commands that we can use in order to enumerate possible registered users in the mail server. Those are: VRFY, EXPN and RCPT TO.

```bash
#Connect to the SMTP service:
nc -nvC $IPADDRESS $PORT
#Use VERY to verify possbile users:
VRFY admin
#Server should return status code of 2XX if the user exists.
```

We can automate the user enumeration using different tools:

* **Nmap:** NSE have the script "smtp-enum-users.nse" that searches for valid usernames using the EXPN command (note that the EXPN command sometimes is disabled, so this script will report nothing).

* **[SMTP-user-enum](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/user-enumeration/smtp-user-enum):** Great tool to automate the user enumeration. It allows to specify the command to use (VRFY, EXPN or RCPT).

* **[ISMTP](https://github.com/crunchsec/ismtp):** Tool to automate the process of SMTP User Enumeration, SMTP Spoofing, and/or SMTP relay.
