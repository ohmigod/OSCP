# Windows Enumeration

## User Enumeration

Who we are? In which groups we are?
```bash
whoami

net user $USERNAME
```

Are there more users on the machine?

```bash
net user
```

_____

## OS Version and Architecture

Does the name of the host reveals some functional roles (SRV, DB,WEB...) or any pattern client(n), client(n+1).. that could help discover additional machines?

```bash
hostname
```

How old is the kernel/OS? May we find some exploits?

```bash
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version" C:"System Type"
```

_____

## Running Processes and Services

Is there any process or service that might allow us to elevate privileges?

```bash
#/SVC: specific Windows Services
taslist /SVC
#Output doesn't list processes run by privileged users, we need higher privileges to gather this information.
```

**Note:** Process must run as privileged user.

_____

## Networking information

Do we have access to other networks (to pivot)? If true, how do we route the traffic?

```bash
ipconfig /all

route print
```

Which ports are open? Is any of those ports only available through the loopback address?

```bash
#View active network connections:
netstat -ano
#Output can contain ESTABLISHED connections, which can indicate that other users are connected to this machine and we can try to target later.
```

_____

## Firewall status and Rules

Is there any service running on the machine blocked by the firewall and only accessible by the loopback address? Can we gather information about inbound/outbound filtering (to facilitate port forwarding and tunneling while pivoting)?

```bash
#Inspect firewall profile:
netsh advfirewall show currentprofile
#If the firewall is active we can have a look at the rules:
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
```

_____

## Scheduled Tasks

Are there any scheduled task on the machine? Does it contain any misconfigured permission?

```bash
#/query: Displays tasks
#/fo LIST: output format to simple list
#/v: Verbose
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```

_____

## Installed Applications and patch levels

Which applications are installed on the system? Are these outdated and vulnerable?

```bash
#List applications installed by the Windows Installer:
wmic product get name, version, vendor
```

Does the system miss any important security update? How long since last update?

```bash
#List system-wide updates (KBXXXXXX):
wmic qfe get Caption, Description, HotFixID, InstalledOn
```

_____

## R/W Files and Directories

Is there any world readable file/directory where we can obtain information? Is there any world writable file/directory that we can modify (executed under the context of a privileged user)?

```bash
#Change $PATH
#Using accesschk:
accesschk.exe -uws "Everyone" "$PATH"

#Using Powershell:
PS> Get-ChildItem "$PATH" -R ecurse | Get-ACL | ?{$_.AccessToString -match "Everyone\sAllow\s\sModify"}
```

_____

## Unmounted Filesystems

Are there any unmounted disk? If we find one, mount it and enumerate for interesting information:

```bash
#List mounted and unmounted drives:
mountvol
```

_____

## Device Drivers

Are there any device driver vulnerable on the system that we can exploit?

```bash
#Display list of loaded drivers:
PS> driverquery.exe /v /fo csv | ConvertFrom-CSV | Select-Object ‘Display Name’, ‘Start Mode’, Path

#Get drivers & their version:
PS> Get-WmiObject Win32_PnPSignedDriver | Select-Object DeviceName, DriverVersion, Manufacturer

#Driver version of an specific driver searched by $NAME:
Get-WmiObject Win32_PnPSignedDriver | Select-Object DeviceName, DriverVersion, Manufacturer | Where-Object {$_.DeviceName -like "*$NAME*"}
```

_____

## Binaries that AutoElevate

Can we run Windows Installer Packages with elevated privileges?

```bash
reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Insta ller

reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Inst aller
```

If this setting is enabled (0x1), we could craft an MSI file and run it to elevate our privileges.
