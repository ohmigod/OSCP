# Scheduled Tasks

Windows can be configured to run a script or a task every X minutes. Those tasks run as the context of the owner which can lead to privilege escalation.

List all scheduled tasks:

```bash
#The output doesn't show all, only the visible by the user.
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v

#With powershell:
Get-ScheduledTask | where {$_.TaskPath -notlike "\Microsoft*"} | ft TaskName,TaskPath,State
```

The output might be huge so it is interesting to poke manually in order to find any interesting script (.ps1) which can be a potential task.
