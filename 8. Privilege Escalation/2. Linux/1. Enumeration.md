# Linux Enumeration

## User Enumeration

Who we are? Are we a member of an interesting group?
```bash
whoami

id
```

Are there more users on the machine? Maybe some service-users?

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

_____

## OS Version and Architecture

Does the name of the host reveals some functional roles (SRV, DB,WEB...) or any pattern client(n), client(n+1).. that could help discover additional machines?

```bash
hostname
```

How old is the kernel/OS? May we find some exploits?

```bash
cat /etc/issue #OS Version

cat /etc/*-release #OS Version

uname -a #Kernel Version
```

_____

## Running Processes and Services

Is there any process or service that might allow us to elevate privileges?

```bash
ps aux
```

**Note:** Process must run as privileged user.

_____

## Networking information

Do we have access to other networks (to pivot)? If true, how do we route the traffic?

```bash
#Depending on the Linux version:
ip a
ifconfig -a

#Depending on the Linux version:
route
routel
```

Which ports are open? Is any of those ports only available through the loopback address?

```bash
#View active network connections:
netstat -anp
ss -anp
```

_____


##Â Firewall status and Rules

Is there any service running on the machine blocked by the firewall and only accessible by the loopback address? Can we gather information about inbound/outbound filtering (to facilitate port forwarding and tunneling while pivoting)?

```bash
#On Linux systems we need root permissions to view iptables rules. However, we can search for specific files with weak permissions:
/etc/iptables #View files inside thi directory.
find / -name "iptables" #Review this instruction
```

_____

## Scheduled Tasks

Are there any scheduled task on the machine? Does it contain any misconfigured permission?

```bash
#Timer scheduled tasks:
ls -lah /etc/cron*
#Specific scheduled tasks:
cat /etc/crontab
```
