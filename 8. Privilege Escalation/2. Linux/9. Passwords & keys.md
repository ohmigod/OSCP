# Passwords and Keys

Password for services may be stored in plaintext in config files. Passwords re-use can be an easy way to escalate to root.

## History files

```bash
.bash_history
.mysql_history
.nano_history
.
.
```

## Config files

It's always worth checking for config files, they usually store plaintext passwords.

## SSH keys

Found private key? Try login with ssh.
