# Cron Jobs

Cron table files (crontabs) store the configuration for cron jobs.

Default locations:

```bash
#User crontabs:
/var/spool/cron/
/var/spool/cron/crontabs

#System wide crontabs:
/etc/crontab
```

Check all crons to search for misconfigurations (Write permissions) in order to modify the script and gain code execution.

## PATH environment

If a cron program does not use absolute path, and one of the PATH directories is writable, we would be able to create a new file with the same name as the cron.

Watch crontab PATH:

```bash
cat /etc/crontab
```

##Â Wildcards

Since filenames in Linux are very permissive and file expansion happens before the command is executed, we create files to pass as argument:

```bash 
touch ./-l
touch ./-a
ls *
```

We can visit [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io) website to try escape the shell and escalate to root.
