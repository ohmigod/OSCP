# Linux Auto-Enumeration

Since manually checking everything can be very time-consuming we can use various scripts to automate the process.

## [Unix Privesc Check](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/audit/unix-privesc-check)

Unix-privesc-checker is a script that runs on Unix systems (tested on Solaris 9, HPUX 11, Various Linuxes, FreeBSD 6.2).  It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivilged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases).
