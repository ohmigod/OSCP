# Privesc Strategy

1. Check your user (whoami, id...)
2. Run smart enumeration with increasing levels.
3. Run linenum or other scripts.
4. Manual enumeration (g0tmi1k blog or smth).

- Spend time reading the results of the outputs.
- Make notes of findings in LSE.sh
- Avoid rabbit holes by creating a checklist.
- Quick look at common files (in our home directory) and not that common (/var/backup, /var/logs).
- Try fast privesc first (sudo, suid and crons).
- Look at processes, enumerate versions and search exploits.
- Check for internal ports (can forward them).
