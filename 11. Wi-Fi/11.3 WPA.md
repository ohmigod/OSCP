# WPA

## Using WiFite

> WiFite sends client deauthentication requests to force a reauthentication handhsake which can be captured and analyzed.

**1.** Configure WiFite to generate a random MAC address:

```bash
wifite --mac --aircrack
```

**2.** Launch WiFite to see all the active networks and watch the "CLIENT" column (there should be clients). Wait some minutes if nothing appears. Once done, press Cntrl + C and select the target.

**3.** WiFite starts with some WPS attacks (can skip with Cntrl + C and move to WPA attacks). Once finished, WiFite has run an active WPA attack on the selected network by checking for clients, deauthenticating them, and listening for their reauthentication sequence. It found it and captured the packets. If the scanning was successful, WiFite saved it (.pcap file in a HS directory).

**4.** WiFite doesn't progress with cracking, but we can use Aircrack to extract the password using a dictionary search.

```bash
aircrack-ng $PCAPFILE -w $WORDLIST
```
