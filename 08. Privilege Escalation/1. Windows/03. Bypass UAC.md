# Bypass UAC

## Windows 10 UAC Bypass - Fodhelper.exe

Windows 10 environments allow users to manage language settings for a variety of Windows features such as typing, text to speech etc. When a user is requesting to open “Manage Optional Features” in Windows Settings in order to make a language change a process is created under the name fodhelper.exe. This **[fodhelper.exe](https://pentestlab.blog/2017/06/07/uac-bypass-fodhelper/)** process is running as high integrity and can give the opportunity to an attacker to execute code with the same level of privileges if they can be abused in a certain way.
