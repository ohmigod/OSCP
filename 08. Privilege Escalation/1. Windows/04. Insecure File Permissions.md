# Insecure File Permissions

Does any path that executes a Windows Service (as a privileged user) have full RW permissions for Everyone? This could lead a low-privileged user to replace the executable used by this service and put a malicious one.

**Step 1:** List running services:

```bash
Get-WmiObject win32_service | Select-Object Name, State, PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}
```

Note: Interesting services are the ones that are not inside the common system32\ directory.

**Step 2:** Enumerate permissions on the target service using icacls Windows Utility:

```bash
#Change BINARY_PATH to the absolute path of the .exe file, including the /filename.exe
icacls "$BINARY_PATH"
```

If the permissions are, for example, full access to BUILTIN\Users gruop, that means that any user can read and write it.

ICalc permissions:

|Mask|Permissions   |
|----|--------------|
|F   |Full          |
|M   |Modify        |
|RX  |Read and Write|
|R   |Read-only     |
|W   |Write-Only    |


**Step 3:** Change the binary (.exe) from the service with a malicious one. Restart the service (if we have enough privileges), restart the system or wait for someone to reboot it.

We can check if the service will start automatically after a reboot with the following command:

```bash
wmic service where caption="$SERVICENAME" get name, caption, state, start mode
#If output is "Auto" means that the service will start automatically after a reboot.
```

If it's set to Auto, reebot:

```bash
reboot /r /t 0 #/r for reboot /t for wait in seconds
```

## AccessEnum 

There's no built-in way to quickly view user accesses to a tree of directories or keys. AccessEnum gives you a full view of your file system and Registry security settings in seconds, making it the ideal tool for helping you find security holes and lock down permissions where necessary.

## AccessChk 

Windows administrators often need to know what kind of accesses specific users or groups have to resources including files, directories, Registry keys, global objects and Windows services. AccessChk quickly answers these questions with an intuitive interface and output.
