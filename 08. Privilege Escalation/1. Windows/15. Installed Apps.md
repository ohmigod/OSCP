# Installed Apps

Installed applications can have vulnerabilities like BOF (if running), unquoted service paths, write permissions...

For BOF vulnerability, first enumerate running programs:

```bash
tasklist /V
```

We can use seatbelt.exe to search for non-standard proccesses:

```bash
.\seatbelt.exe NonstandardProcesses
```

Search for installed apps using WinPEAS:

```bash
.\winpeas.exe quiet procesinfo
```

Use exploit-db or github to find existing exploits.
