# Windows Auto-Enumeration

Since manually checking everything can be very time-consuming we can use various scripts to automate the process.

##Â [Windows Privesc Check](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/windows-privesc-check)

Windows-privesc-check is standalone executable that runs on Windows systems. It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases).

## WinPEAS
