# Weak File Permissions

> use ls command to check the file permissions. Alternatively, namei can also be used to recursively list file permissions ($ namei -l /PathToCheck/).

Using script:

```bash
./lse.sh -l 1 #Level 1
```

Important files/directories to check:

```bash
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
#Search for backups of the ones above
/home/$user
/
/tmp
/var/backups
```
