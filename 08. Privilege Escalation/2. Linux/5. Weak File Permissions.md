# Weak File Permissions

> use ls command to check the file permissions. Alternatively, namei can also be used to recursively list file permissions ($ namei -l /PathToCheck/).

Using script:

```bash
./lse.sh -l 1 #Level 1
```

Important files/directories to check:

* Web files/directory
* Configuration files/directory
* Sensitive files (encrypted data, password, key)/directory
* Log files (security logs, operation logs, admin logs)/directory
* Executables (scripts, EXE, JAR, class, PHP, ASP)/directory
* Database files/directory
* Temp files /directory
* Upload files/directory

Examples: 
```bash
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
#Search for backups of the ones above
/home/$user
/
/tmp
/var/backups
```
