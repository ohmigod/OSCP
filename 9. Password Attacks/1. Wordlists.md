# Wordlists
> A word list is just what it says it is. It is a list of words. Words that may or may not match someone's password.

## SecLists

SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more.

## CeWL

This tool spiders a targets website collecting unique words specific to our target organization.


```bash
cewl $DOMAIN -m $NUMBER -w $WORDLIST
#-m: minimum characters
#-w: output file
```

Passwords obtained from the CeWL command are very simple. We can try to add some permutations in order to match a hypothetical password policy.

## Permutations

We can use JTR to create password permutations from a given wordlist. To do this, we need to edit the /etc/john/john.com file and add the following line:

```bash
#First, locate the following segment in the file:
[List.Rules:Wordlist]

#Add a new line. For example, add two numbers (0 to 99) at the end of each password:
$[0-9]$[0-9]
```

Save the file and execute the following command:

```bash
john --wordlist=$WORDLIST --rules --stdout > $NEWWORDLIS
```

## Specific Wordlists

We can use "crunch" to create a personal bruteforce wordlist. Take in mind the following placeholders:

| @ | Lower case|
|---|-----------|
|**,**  | **Uppser case**|
|**%**  | **Numeric**   |
|**^** | **Special char**|

```bash
#The following command will generate a wordlist full of 8 characters that starts with a Uppercase, following by 6 lowercases, a number and a special char:
crunch 8 8 -t ,@@@@@%^
```

```bash
#The following command will generate a wordlist with password of 6 characters long that only contains some of these letters "0123456789ABCDEF":
crunch 6 6 0123456789ABCDEF -o $OUTPUTFILE
```
