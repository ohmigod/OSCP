# Active Directory

> A server running Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) role is called a domain controller. It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type networkâ€”assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software.

Ways to gain control of the domain:

* Compromise a member of the Domain Admins group.
* Compromise the domain controller.

## Enumerate Domain Users - Using net

Which users exists on the domain? Do they have some prefixes (xxx_admin, xxx_service) that identify accounts by their function?

```bash
#List of domain users:
net user /domain
```

Found an interesting user? In which groups he member of? Anyone on Domain Admins?

```bash
net user $USER /domain
```

## Enumerate Domain Users - Using PS

Another way to enumerate users:

As unprivileged user, first disable ExecutionPolicy:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
````

Next, execute the following script:

```bash  
#Change "filter" variable to change the query result
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
$PDC = ($domainObj.PdcRoleOwner).Name
$SearchString = "LDAP://"
$SearchString += $PDC + "/"
$DistinguishedName = "DC=$($domainObj.Name.Replace('.', ',DC='))"
$SearchString += $DistinguishedName
$Searcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher([ADSI]$SearchString)
$objDomain = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry
$Searcher.SearchRoot = $objDomain
$Searcher.filter="samAccountType=805306368"
$Result = $Searcher.FindAll()
Foreach($obj in $Result)
{
Foreach($prop in $obj.Properties)
{
$prop
}
Write-Host "------------------------" }
```

## Enumeration Service Principal Names (SPN)

When an application is executed, it must always do so in the context of an operating system user. If a user launches an application, that user account defines the context. However, services launched by the system itself use the context based on a Service Account.

Examples are: Exchange, SQL, IIS.. that have a service account associated in AD.

By enumerating all registered SPNs in the domain we can obtain the IP addresses + port number.

Example of script that searches for http SPN:

```bash
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain() $PDC = ($domainObj.PdcRoleOwner).Name
$SearchString = "LDAP://" $SearchString += $PDC + "/"
$DistinguishedName = "DC=$($domainObj.Name.Replace('.', ',DC='))"
$SearchString += $DistinguishedName
$Searcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher([ADSI]$SearchString) $objDomain = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry
$Searcher.SearchRoot = $objDomain
$Searcher.filter="serviceprincipalname=*http*"
$Result = $Searcher.FindAll()
Foreach($obj in $Result)
{
Foreach($prop in $obj.Properties)
{
$prop
}
}
```

The output shows that a webserver (xxxxx.com) is registered in the Domain and we can obtain the IP address to try to exploit that service.

Here is a [link](http://adsecurity.org/?page_id=183) to a good amount of SPNs to query about.

This [Get-SPN script](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire/blob/master/data/module_source/situational_awareness/network/Get-SPN.ps1) does the same as the one above.
