# Application Platform Configuration

> Web applications can contain a lot of functionality (examples, documentation, test pages) that should be removed if not used to avoid post-install exploitation.

#####  Test objectives

* Ensure default and known files have been removed.
* Validate that no debugging code or extensions are left.
* Review the logging mechanism set in place.

### Sample and known files/directories

Web/application servers provide default applications and files that can be vulnerable in the future.

### Comment review

It's always worth to try to find comments in the HTML/dynamic code.
