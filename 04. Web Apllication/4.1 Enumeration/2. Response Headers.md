# Response Headers

> Check out header values in server responses. Headers like Server, X-Powered-by or X-Generator can leak information about the technologies used in the back-end.

## Ways to inspect response headers

* **Browser Developer Tools** > Network tab > Inspect manually the response.

* **Burpsuite**

* **wget:**

```bash
#Save headers in a file:
wget --save-headers $URL
```

* **curl:**

```bash
curl -I $URL #HEAD Request
curl -i $URL #GET request which will include the header response

#Note: a HEAD request is not the same as a GET request, therefore the web server may respond differently.
```

## Non-standard headers

Headers that start with **X-** are non-standard HTTP headers. Headers like Server, X-Powered-by or X-Generator can leak information about the technologies used in the back-end.
