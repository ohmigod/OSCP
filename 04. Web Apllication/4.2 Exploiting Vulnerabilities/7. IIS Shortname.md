# IIS ShortName

> Microsoft IIS contains a flaw that may lead to an unauthorized information disclosure. The issue is triggered during the parsing of a request that contains a tilde character (~). This may allow a remote attacker to gain access to file and folder name information.

It is possible to detect short names of files and directories which have an 8.3 equivalent in Windows by using some vectors in several versions of Microsoft IIS. For instance, it is possible to detect all short-names of ".aspx" files as they have 4 letters in their extensions.

#### IIS ShortName Scanner

[This tool](https://github.com/irsdl/IIS-ShortName-Scanner) works perfectly to exploit this vulnerability. Syntax:

```bash
java -jar 2 20 $URL
```
