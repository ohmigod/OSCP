# Subdomain Takeovers

> The basic premise of a subdomain takeover is a host that points to a particular service not currently in use, which an adversary can use to serve content on the vulnerable subdomain by setting up an account on the third-party service.

Imagine we have stumbled across a subdomain pointing to GitHub pages:

```bash
$ host subdomain.example.com
subdomain.example.com has address 192.30.252.153
subdomain.example.com has address 192.30.252.154
$ whois 192.30.252.153 | grep "OrgName"
OrgName: GitHub, Inc.
```

When navigating to subdomain.example.com, we discover a 404 error page. This 404 page indicates that no content is being served under the top-level directory and that we should attempt to add this subdomain to our personal GitHub repository.

## Enumeration and discovery

#### Passive

Some services, such as DNS Dumpster and VirusTotal, index subdomains that have been crawled in the past allowing you to collect and sort the results quickly without much effort.
[Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git) script gathers subdomains from numerous search engines, SSL certificates, and websites such as DNS Dumpster.
