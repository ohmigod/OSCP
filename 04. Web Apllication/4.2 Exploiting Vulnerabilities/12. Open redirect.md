# Open Redirects

> A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks. 

## Basic

When a URL redirect is passed as argument, try chaning it:

```bash
https://somesite.com/redirect.php?url=$CHANGE_THIS
```

## Hash Based

Sometimes, an additional parameter is used to check the hash of the URL, and both should be correct:

```bash
https://somesite.com/redirect.php?url=$SOME_URL&hash=HASH_OF_SOME_URL
```

## Hash Based + Salt

Apart from hash based URLs, there are cases that the hash is salted:

```bash
salt=123;
encodedurl = md5(salt+$URL)
```

Also, the salt may be passed as an additional parameter.
