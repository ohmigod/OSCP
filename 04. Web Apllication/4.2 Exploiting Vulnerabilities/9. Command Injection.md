# Command Injection

> Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application.

## Payloads

#### Windows & *nix:

```bash
&
&&
|
||
```

#### *nix-based:

```bash
;
Newline (0x0a or \n)

#You can also use backticks or the dollar character to perform inline execution of an injected command within the original command:
` injected command `
$( injected command )
```

* File download (wget) into /var/www or /tmp. Then execute it through the vulnerability.
* Stablishing a netcat connection.
* Using system interpreters (python, bash, perl...).
