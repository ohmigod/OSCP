# Recon-ng
> Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python. Complete with independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, Recon-ng provides a powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be conducted quickly and thoroughly.

##### Starting recon-ng:

```bash
recon-ng
```

##### Searching modules:
```bash
#KEYWORD is a search string (github, google..)
marketplace search $KEYWORD
#We can view full info of the modules by typing:
marketplace info $MODULENAME
```

##### Installing modules:
```bash
marketplace install $MODULENAME
```

##### Load modules:
```bash
marketplace load $MODULENAME
```

**Recon-ng stores results in a local database and these results will feed into other recon-ng modules. You can use the show hosts command to view store data:**
